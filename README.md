# Hanco-Rabie-Udacity-Projects
Udacity - Pixel Art Project
This is the last project for the Udacity course meant to let the user generate a grid-like canvas, and add any color to the boxes that the
grid is made up of. You can choose different colors by clicking on the color wheel tab, then simply click on any box inside the grid to
add that color to it!
